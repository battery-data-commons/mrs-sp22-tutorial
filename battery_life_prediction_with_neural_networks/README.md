# Life Prediction with Neural Networks

Neural networks are an exceptionally-useful tool for creating complex machine learning models. 
In these examples, we demonstrate two examples:

1. [An general overview of how to train neural networks with Keras](./exercise-1_keras.ipynb) ([Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/battery-data-commons/mrs-sp22-tutorial/blob/main/battery_life_prediction_with_neural_networks/exercise-1_keras.ipynb))
1. [A specific example of training a neural network for predicting battery life](./cnn_life_predict.ipynb) ([Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/battery-data-commons/mrs-sp22-tutorial/blob/main/battery_life_prediction_with_neural_networks/cnn_life_predict.ipynb))

Both can run on small computing resources, but are much faster to run on a GPU.
